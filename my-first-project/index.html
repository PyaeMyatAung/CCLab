    <div> <p>The rich phenotypic diversity in coat and plumage color in domestic animals is primarily caused by
        direct selection on pigmentation phenotypes. Characteristic features are selection for viable
        alleles with no or only minor negative pleiotropic effects on other traits, and that alleles often
        evolve by accumulating several consecutive mutations in the same gene. This review provides examples
        of mutations that disrupt or create pigmentation patterns. White spotting patterns in domestic
        animals are often caused by mutations in KIT, microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), or
        endothelin receptor B (EDNRB), impairing migration or survival of melanoblasts. Wild boar piglets
        are camouflage-colored and show a characteristic pattern of dark and light longitudinal stripes.
        This pattern is disrupted by mutations in Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), implying that a functional
        MC1R receptor is required for wild-type camouflage color in pigs. The great majority of pig breeds
        carry MC1R mutations disrupting wild-type color and different mutations causing dominant black color
        were independently selected in European and Asian domestic pigs. The European allele evolved into a
        new allele creating a pigmentation pattern, black spotting, after acquiring a second mutation. This
        second mutation, an insertion of two C nucleotides in a stretch of 6 Cs, is somatically unstable and
        creates black spots after the open reading frame has been restored by somatic mutations. In the
        horse, mutations located in an enhancer downstream of TBX3 disrupt the Dun pigmentation pattern
        present in wild equids, a camouflage color where pigmentation on the flanks is diluted. A
        fascinating example of the creation of a pigmentation pattern is Sex-linked barring in chicken which
        is caused by the combined effect of both regulatory and coding mutations affecting the function of
        CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene associated with familial forms of melanoma in human. These examples
        illustrate how evolution of pigmentation patterns in domestic animals constitutes a model for
        evolutionary change in natural populations.</p></div>
